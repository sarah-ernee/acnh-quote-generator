# Animal Crossing Themed Quote Generator

A random quote generator with an Animal Crossing New Horizons theme (light and dark). Uses open-sourced [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).
This project utilizes CSS animations and Bootstrap to mimic in-game Animal Crossing bubble.

Project deployed on Vercel.

## Cloning & Navigation

1. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to serve localhost.

- Codebase resides main in the src folder where `src/components` stores the Animal Crossing bubble component.
- Parent component `App.js` houses the API calling.

## Future Implementation

1. Dynamic content responsiveness for smaller screens as current project fits nicely for laptop and larger screens only.
2. Link author information to corresponding Wikipedia page.
3. Allow users to copy quote / download as IMG.
